# Lubuntu Client Notes

This is the machine I use most frequently. The hardware specs are limited, but the effect of this limitation is side-stepped by the use of command-line tools and the prudent installation of packages. Beyond the packages installed by default in Lubuntu 12.04, I typically install the following packages:

## Command Line Utilities

- vim
- git
- rdiff-backup
- sox
- sqlite
- dropbox
- googlecl

## GUI Utilities

- chromium
- audacity
- openbox

So there those are.

## Considerations

Some packages are best installed via a package manager (i.e., `apt-get install`) while others are best compiled from source in order to get the latest bugfixes.

Some programs are best used with supplemental user configuration files, and there is no obvious answer to the question of how best to manage the installation, maintenance, and synchronization of such files.
